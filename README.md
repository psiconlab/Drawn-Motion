"Drawn Motion" Android Drawing app
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=accelerometer_test_debug.apk

Drawn Motion is a digital drawing app which draws circular patterns as you move. Take it for a walk... take a bow, see what happens!

Based on and inspired by the artwork of Susan Kruse (https://susankruse.blogspot.com/) and created in collaboration with Ben Neal (www.PsiconLab.co.uk) this drawing app is currently an experimental release.

Move, draw and enjoy.
